/********************************************************************** 
  Obtain measurements from a Honeywell HIH8000 Series sensor connected to an
  Arduino board using I2C protocol (not SPI):
  https://sensing.honeywell.com/sensors/humidity-sensors/HIH8000-series
  
  To adjust the internal settings of the
  sensor such as its I2C address and alarms, use the HIH8000CommandI2C library instead:
  https://github.com/kiatAWDSA/HIH8000Command_I2C
  
  Please note that the pins used for I2C communication are different for each
  Arduino board. For Arduino Uno, the SDA and SCL pins are A4 and A5, respectively.
  A list of boards and corresponding pins can be found at:
